  Example: On load
    When I visit the page "/demo-publication/demo-publication-chapter-1"
    Then the title should be "Demo Publication - Chapter 1"
    And there should be a page link with a title of "Previous" and description text of "Demo Publication"
    And there should be a page link with a title of "Next" and description text of "Demo Publication - Chapter 1 - Page 1"
