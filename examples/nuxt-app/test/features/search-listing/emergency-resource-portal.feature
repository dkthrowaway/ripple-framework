Feature: Collection pages

  As a site I can see a collection of links to other pages and interact with it find the one I want.

  Background:
    Given the endpoint "/api/tide/site" with query "?id=8888" returns fixture "/site/reference" with status 200
    And I am using a "macbook-16" device

  @mockserver
  Example: Emergency resource portal
    Given the endpoint "/api/tide/page" with query "?path=/emergency-recovery-resource-portal-search-for-resource&site=8888" returns fixture "/search-listing/emergency-resource" with status 200
    When I visit the page "/emergency-recovery-resource-portal-search-for-resource"
