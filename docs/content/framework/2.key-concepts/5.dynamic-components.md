Dynamic components are a concept in Ripple that is closely tied to the concept of 'Paragraphs' in Drupal. See the [Drupal documentation for Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs).

Dynamic components/paragraphs can be added to pages in drupal (see [Key concepts - content types](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)).

In Ripple the raw paragraphs from the Drupal JSON API and 'mapped' to a Vue component, along with the props required for that component to render. This Vue component, along with the associated mapping is what is referred to as the 'Dynamic component'.
