Grids are a crucial component of any design system. They provide a framework for arranging content in an appealing and structured manner. 

We've designed the grid for a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness.

## Breakpoints
Ripple has 5 breakpoints. These ensure content is at an optimal layout for readability and accessibility.

| Breakpoint | Width        | Active content area |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
|   XS       | <575px       | 288 – 543px         |
|   S        | 576 – 767px  | 544 – 735px         |
|   M        | 768 – 991px  | 736 – 927px         |
|   L        | 992 – 1199px | 864 – 1071px        |
|   XL       | 1200px +     | 1040px              |

## Grids
The grid is made up of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.

| Breakpoint           | Margins | Gutter  | Column type / width |
|----------------------|---------|---------|---------------------|
|   XS  • <575px       | 16px    | 16px    | Fluid               |
|   S   • 576 – 767px  | 16px    | 16px    | Fluid               |
|   M   • 768 – 991px  | 32px    | 24px    | Fluid               |
|   L   • 992 – 1199px | 64px    | 24px    | Fluid               |
|   XL  • 1200px +     | 80px    | 28px    | Fixed / 61px        |

## Usage
Use the grid system to structure your content.

Most vic.gov.au pages follow a ‘two-thirds and one-third’ layout. But, the grid system allows for more combinations if needed.

Your main content should always be in a two-thirds column. This is even if you’re not using a corresponding one-third column for secondary content.

### Column layouts

| Column Span | Layout      | Breakpoint          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 12          | Full        | XS • S • M • L • XL |
| 6           | Half        | XS • S • M • L • XL |
| 7           | Two thirds  | M • L • XL          |
| 4           | One third   | M • L • XL          |
| 3           | One quarter | L • XL              |
