Ripple is a system of reusable styles, components, patterns and tools for building brand Victoria digital products.

Developed by the Single Digital Presence (SDP) team in the Department of Government Services, Ripple:
- makes it easier for citizens to **find**, **understand** and **use** government information
- makes creating Brand Victoria approved content, assets and sites easy
- increases delivery speed for digital products and services. 

Over 50 government websites use Ripple, including our main [vic.gov.au](https://www.vic.gov.au) platform. These sites attract millions of views per month.

## Why use Ripple?

### Ripple solves the hard problems so you don’t have to

We spent the past 5 years refining Ripple based on user feedback to ensure it:
- meets the publishing needs of government users
- makes it easier for citizens to interact with government services.

Ripple users can be confident their site’s design and development is based on industry standards and best practices for:
- accessibility
- SEO
- security
- performance.

Users can easily navigate sites regardless of technical ability, location or device.

Designers and developers can create consistent digital experiences across Victorian Government sites.

### Ripple gives you efficient and reusable digital resources

Ripple promotes efficiency and reuse by providing reusable styles, components and patterns.

It provides a set of standards to manage design at scale, to:
- reduce redundancy
- create a shared language
- provide visual consistency.

Developer contributions can be shared across projects, adding value to all government departments. This results in reduced project development time and expense.

### Ripple is by government, for government

The Ripple Design System has been made open-source to foster collaboration across government. By making the system open-source, departments and agencies can help improve the citizen experience across government. Ripple has been developed by government, for government and retains all intellectual property and expertise.
