This section contains information about the Ripple user interface libraries. These libraries are a collection of UI components which implement the Ripple Design System. The components are written in Vue and are split accross two packages: 
- `ripple-ui-core`: A collection of common UI components used in SDP sites. For example buttons, cards, icons and typography.
- `ripple-ui-forms`: A collection of form inputs and support for building complex forms via [Formkit](https://formkit.com/)


> **These docs are for Ripple 2**
>
> Ripple 2 is a complete rebuild. If you are looking for information about the previous version of Ripple please visit the [original Ripple GitHub repo](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple).

> **Are you developing a site on the SDP platform?**
>
> This section is about the Ripple UI component libraries, and there is a lot more to developing a site on the Single Digital Presence (SDP) stack that is not covered here.
> 
> For information about using Ripple in SDP sites, visit the [Ripple Framework for SDP documentation](/framework)

## Accessing the Source code

Ripple 2 is an open source project and the source code can be found in the [ripple-framework monorepo on Github](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple-framework).

This monorepo contains a lot more than just the UI libraries so we've provided direct links to packages below:
- [View `ripple-ui-core` on Github](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple-framework/tree/develop/packages/ripple-ui-core)
- [View `ripple-ui-forms` on Github](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple-framework/tree/develop/packages/ripple-ui-forms)

## Viewing examples in Storybook

The Ripple Storybook has information about props and slots that each Vue component supports. [View the Ripple storybook](/storybook) to start exploring the available components.

Most of the examples found on this documentation site link directly examples in storybook.
