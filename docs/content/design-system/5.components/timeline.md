## Usage
A timeline displays a visual journey of short blocks of content in a linear order. Each block can be actionable for users to navigate through to related content.

A timeline can include a combination of:
- heading
- subheading
- summary
- image.

Use timelines to show a clear and sequential order of information. This assists users in linking pieces of information together.

Some examples include:
- dates
- steps
- stages
- events
- actions
- outcomes.

The timeline component is ordered from top to bottom.

Use between 3 to 8 discrete sections of content, so the user is not overwhelmed.

### When and how to use
- Always include a title for the entire timeline.
- Add a heading, subheading, short summary and optional image for each block.
- Only include 3 to 8 blocks per timeline.
- Add a link if you're providing more details on another page.

### When and how not to use
- Don't add fewer than 3 or more than 8 blocks.
- Don't use without a heading for each block.
- Never include unrelated content.
- Don't use if content doesn't flow in a sequential or linear order. Consider bullets points instead.

### Default
