## Usage

Use a media gallery to collate a series of related images into a gallery. Media gallery allows users to scroll through related images. It's best used for displaying images.

Media gallery combines images and text to give users context within the content.

Media items inside a media gallery will display as either landscape or portrait, at predefined ratios.

See [media](/design-system/components/media/) for information relating to file type, ratios and focal point.
