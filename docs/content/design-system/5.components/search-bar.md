## Usage

Use the search bar to help users find what they are looking for.

Users often rely on search to find the information they need. You can use it as an alternative to on-page navigation.

Users will use keywords in the search bar, often using different words or phrases. Search is especially helpful for users when navigating site that have many pages. 

The search bar includes:

- text - placeholder and input text
- search button label
- search button icon
- optional predictive list - present suggested keywords to the user
- optional refine search link - expand to present advanced filters to the user.

### How this component works 

#### Input text
Include short, descriptive placeholder text. This tells the user what they can search for.

The text the user inputs replaces the placeholder text.

#### Search button
The search button contains a button label and search icon.

Smaller devices show a responsive variant with:
- only a search icon
- no button label. 

This gives the user more space to write search text. Users know that a magnifying glass represents a search function. 

The word ‘Search’ must appear in the alt text for screen readers.

The button type should be a submit button. This lets a user conduct a search:
- using the enter/return key
- using fewer keystrokes
- by choosing a suggestion (if applicable)
- that afterwards, still displays the search keyword. 

####  Predictive keyword list

Useful suggestions let users find what they need with less effort. They also reduce spelling errors and typing.

Use a short, ordered list of no more than 10 keyword suggestions.

They should appear after only a few keystrokes.

Let the user scroll through keyword suggestions using keyboard navigation, with the Esc key to exit. 

Scrolling ‘down’ past the last suggestion should loop the user back to the first one. Scrolling ‘up’ before the first suggestion should loop the user to the last (bottom) one.

### When and how to use
