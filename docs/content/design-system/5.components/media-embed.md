## Usage

Use media embed to add visual elements including images, videos, graphs, infographics, maps and charts to your page content. 

Use the optional text to combine the visual element with text, so that the user understands the visual elementâ€™s context. Optional text should always be used for complex media like graphs and charts with supporting data.

Media can be an image or video. Images can display as small, medium or large.

When using the complex media variant, media displays at either a max width or height. This ensures it always displays the full image.

See [media](/design-system/components/media/) for information relating to file type, ratios and focal point.

## Variants

Media embed has 3 variants:
- image
- video
- complex media.

Depending on the variant used, you can display:
- a caption
- metadata
- a transcript link
- accompanying data. 

### Image

The image variant has 4 display options:

- landscape / 16:9 ratio
- portrait / 3:4 ratio
- square / 1:1 ratio
- avatar / circle.

You can display portrait, landscape and square as small, medium or large. Avatar only displays in small or medium.

The media gets cropped to fill the selected ratio. Make sure the media's focal point is best placed to accurately represent the media item.

### Video

A 'view transcript' link displays by default. Videos must have both closed captions and a transcript.

Include a supporting caption to give extra context to the user.

### Complex media

Complex media items contain detail. They include:

- infographics
- graphs
- flowchart
- maps.

You can support media by including:

- optional supporting data such as content or tables
- a view fullscreen link
- a download media link.

Optional supporting data displays in a dropdown list. Use the type of content that will best communicate your supporting data to the user. For example, some information is conveyed better by a table, rather than plain text. 

Complex media will always display the full image. The media item will display at a predefined max height or width.

When the media is fullscreen, it displays in the media fullscreen component.
