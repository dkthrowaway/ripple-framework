title: Date input
description: The Date input component helps users enter a date.
layout: page
label: Core

## Usage
Use date input to let users to enter a date they already know, or a date they can enter without needing a calendar.

Date input has 3 fields: day, month and year.

Don’t set this component to automatically tab between these fields. This can be confusing and jarring for the user.

### How to use this component
You must use a form label with a date input.

You can use an date input with:
- requirement label
- hint text
- placeholder text.

#### Avoid placeholder text
Avoid using placeholder text where possible. It disappears when a user starts typing. Not all screen readers will read out placeholder text. Its colour often lacks the contrast needed for accessible content when using some browser default styling.

If placeholder text can’t be avoided, don’t use it to replace a label or hint text. Don’t use it to show an example or to include any critical information.

#### Hint text
Hint text can be used to tell the user what, or how, to successfully complete a date input.

For example, hint text can include specific formatting examples or requirements.

Only use hint text where it’s needed. Don’t use it just to keep the layout consistent with other fields in the form.

### When and how to use
- Always use date inputs with a label.
- Write short and concise labels.
- Use hint text to show the expected date format, for example, ‘07 11 2022’.

### When and how not to use
- If it’s not likely users will know the exact date, don’t use date input.
- Don’t use without a form label or hint text specifying the expected date format.
- Avoid placeholder text because it can cause accessibility issues.
- Don’t disable copy and paste.
- Don’t use placeholder text to give instructions or important examples.
- Don’t write ambiguous error messages only stating what's wrong - explain how the user can fix it.

## Theming
Date input uses colour to show interactive states. A date input field in an active state will adopt the same colour as the overall site’s focus state colour. This means a user’s experience of a date input field remains consistent while it transitions from a focus to an active state.

## Rationale
The active and focus states both use the site’s focus state colour. This creates a seamless user experience. If we used a different colour, keyboard users would have colour changes between focusing on and interacting with an input field. This could be jarring or confusing to users.

This occurs across all form and input elements, for a consistent experience.
