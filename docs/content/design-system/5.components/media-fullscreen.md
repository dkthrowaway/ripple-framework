## Usage

Use media fullscreen to give users the option to toggle a fullscreen view of some media items. Media fullscreen can display media and content from your pageâ€™s media embed and media gallery components. It always displays the full media item, regardless of its ratio. The item fills the width or height of the available area.

Fullscreen view includes the media item's title and caption.

Media fullscreen takes over the viewport completely. A transparent background helps users to know they are still on the page. When a user closes fullscreen view, they return to that same item in the gallery.

See [media](/design-system/components/media/) for information relating to file type, ratios and focal point.
